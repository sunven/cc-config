## Key Successes

1. **Code Review Process Excellence**
   - Systematic identification and fixing of issues across 3 stories
   - Applied fixes and committed changes
   - Improved test pass rates through targeted interventions

2. **Performance Optimization Methodology**
   - Epic 6-4 established optimization patterns adopted by subsequent stories
   - Bundle size 88% under requirement
   - Virtualization reduced render time by 60%

3. **Accessibility-First Design**
   - Epic 6-5 demonstrated how to integrate a11y into every component
   - 93% test pass rate on accessibility tests
   - Complete i18n system with EN/ZH support

4. **Systematic Problem Identification**
   - Identified integration testing issues (44.7% pass rate)
   - Created action plan for improvement
   - Commitment to CI quality gates

## Challenges Identified

1. **Integration Testing Failure Rate (44.7%)**
   - Primary cause: Complex store integration and component rendering issues
   - Impact: Critical workflow validation incomplete
   - Requires: Dedicated sprint to fix

2. **Test Infrastructure vs. Test Quality**
   - High test count but many failures indicate systemic issues
   - Need better testing patterns and mock configuration

3. **E2E Tests Not Executed**
   - Infrastructure correctly configured but actual execution pending
   - Risk: Testing gaps in real-world scenarios

## Lessons Learned

1. **Infrastructure vs Quality** - We have lots of tools but need better usage patterns
2. **Testing Needs to Be Part of Design** - Not an afterthought
3. **Code Review Process is Highly Effective** - Should continue for future epics
4. **Performance Optimization Early** - Establish patterns at start of epic

## Critical Path Items

**Before Starting Any New Epic:**

1. **Fix Integration Testing** (Owner: Charlie & Dana, Deadline: 2 weeks)
2. **Deploy Epic 6** (Owner: Sunven, Deadline: 2 weeks)
3. **Stakeholder Acceptance Meeting** (Owner: Sunven, Deadline: Before deployment)

## Readiness Assessment

**Testing & Quality:** Good
⚠️ Action Needed: Improve integration test pass rate from 44.7% to 80%+

**Deployment:** Planned
⚠️ Scheduled For: 2 weeks (synchronized with integration testing fixes)

**Stakeholder Acceptance:** Pending
⚠️ Action Needed: Schedule formal acceptance meeting before deployment

**Technical Health:** Good
Primary concerns in test infrastructure, not core code

**Unresolved Blockers:** None

## Significant Discoveries

No significant discoveries that require epic updates. The plan for future work remains sound.
